Idea: Web or app based synth
Goal: Can take in input sound, repitch it to match the pitches of a half of a half grand piano, and make it playable with a computer keyboard. Ex: if shantanu or kegan played their respective instruments, we would be able to reconstruct at least two octaves worth of sounds

Tools:
Python
VS Code
GitHub
Devlog or something
Computer keyboard

Hackathon Info:
6:00pm start on Friday 3/6
Submission by Saturday 3/7 

Python Libraries (Testing):
pip install numpy scipy sounddevice pyaudio audiolazy python-rtmidi PyQt5

GUI libraries:
Tkinter - really easy to use but very old
Dearpygui - okay, weird middle ground between 
Pyqt - written like C++, but the best one
t
Audio libraries:
pyaudio
Scikitsound
Librosa - for analysis
Base python audio library?
Pygame


Look into multicore stuff if high latency, but unlikely to gain any significant efficiencies
